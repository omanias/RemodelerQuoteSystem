Create a Permission Management System similar to phpMyAdmin's simple checkbox interface, but for a web application. The system should focus on:

Admin Permission Management Interface:


Grid/table view showing:

All database tables in rows
All user roles in columns
Checkbox matrix for permissions


Permission types per table:

View
Create
Edit
Delete


Ability to:

Set permissions by role
Set permissions by table
Bulk enable/disable permissions
Save permission configurations




User Access Control:


Entry-level permissions:

Users can only see their own created entries by default
Admin can grant access to view others' entries
Option to limit edit/delete to entry creator


Role-based visibility:

Define what tables each role can access
Control CRUD operations per role
Handle nested relationships between tables




Core Features:


Simple checkbox interface for permissions
Real-time permission updates
Permission inheritance system
Override capabilities for specific cases
Audit log of permission changes

Technical Requirements:

React with TypeScript
State management for permissions
Database schema for storing permissions
API endpoints for permission management
Role-based middleware
Permission validation system

Data Structure:

Permissions table:

Role ID
Table name
Permission type (view/edit/delete)
Created by
Created at


Roles table
User-Role relationships
Entry ownership tracking

UI Components:

Permission matrix (tables × roles)
Bulk action controls
Role management interface
User assignment interface
Permission audit log viewer

Example Interface:
CopyTables/Roles | Admin | Manager | User | Guest
--------------------------------------------
Quotes      | [√]   | [√]     | [~]  | [ ]
Products    | [√]   | [√]     | [√]  | [√]
Categories  | [√]   | [√]     | [√]  | [√]
Users       | [√]   | [ ]     | [ ]  | [ ]
[√] Full Access
[~] Own Entries Only
[ ] No Access
The system should:

Be simple to configure
Be easy to maintain
Have clear visual feedback
Include permission inheritance
Support bulk operations
Maintain audit logs
Handle edge cases
Be scalable for new tables/roles

Security Considerations:

Permission validation on frontend and backend
Prevention of permission escalation
Secure permission storage
Audit logging of changes
Role hierarchy enforcement
Session validation

Implementation should focus on simplicity and usability while maintaining robust security measures. The interface should be intuitive enough for non-technical administrators to manage permissions effectively.
